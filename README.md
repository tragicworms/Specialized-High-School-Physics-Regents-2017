# Specialized High School Physics Regents 2017
This is my first project for the LaGuardia Data Analytics Python course, DATA201: an analysis of the 2017 Physics Regents results from the 9 NYC specialized high schools.

# Data
The dataset used in this analysis was provided by the course. It contains data on the results of Regents exams from high schools across NYC from 2015-2017. For the purposes of my analysis I filtered the initial 21,000+ rows of data down to the relevant 9 rows representing the 2017 Physics Regents results from the city's specialized high schools.
