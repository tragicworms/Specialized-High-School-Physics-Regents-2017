# Specialized High School Physics Regents 2017
This is my first project for the LaGuardia Data Analytics Python course, DATA201: an analysis of the 2017 Physics Regents results from the 9 NYC specialized high schools.

The dataset provided did not appear to have Physics Regents results from Brooklyn Latin School so it was omitted from the analysis, making it 8 schools instead of 9.
